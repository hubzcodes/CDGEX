  <p>Discretionary Digital Asset Allocation</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    HNReserve operates as a privately managed capital operation focused on liquid
    global markets, including digital assets, equities, and gold.
  </p>
  <p>
    Capital is deployed selectively. Market participation is determined by structure,
    volatility conditions, and liquidity — not by the need for constant activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    When conditions are unclear, capital preservation takes priority over engagement.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Decision Framework</h2>
  <p>
    Allocation decisions are based on defined market conditions rather than prediction.
    Structure, volatility behavior, and broader positioning are evaluated before exposure
    is considered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trades are executed only when risk parameters can be reasonably defined.
    Inactivity is preferred over forced participation.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Operational Principles</h2>
  <p>• No leverage guarantees under any circumstance.</p>
  <p>• Market exposure is selective, not continuous.</p>
  <p>• Capital held in cash or stable form is treated as an active position.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Capital Constraints</h2>
  <p>
    Intake capacity is limited. HNReserve reserves the right to refuse capital allocations
    based on operational or market considerations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scaling is capacity-based and adjusted according to liquidity and execution limits.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Communication Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Telegram is the sole official communication channel. No unsolicited direct messages
    are initiated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Verification is required prior to access. Requests for private keys, recovery phrases,
    or remote access are never made.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why We Do Not Display Performance</h2>
  <p>
    Public performance figures are often misleading, incomplete, or taken out of context.
    Short-term results do not accurately represent risk exposure or capital discipline.
  </p>
  <p>
    HNReserve avoids publishing performance metrics to prevent misinterpretation and
    unrealistic expectation setting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Evaluation is conducted privately and contextually, not as promotional material.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Participant Profile</h2>
  <p>
    This operation is structured for individuals who understand market uncertainty
    and accept variability in outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not designed for guaranteed returns, fixed income expectations,
    or short-term speculation.

  <h2>Questions & Clarifications</h2>
  <p><strong>Is profit guaranteed?</strong><br>
  No. Market participation involves risk, including potential loss of capital.</p>

  <p><strong>How often are trades taken?</strong><br>
  There is no fixed frequency. Activity depends entirely on market conditions.</p>

  <p><strong>Can I withdraw anytime?</strong><br>
  Terms are discussed during onboarding. Flexibility depends on current exposure.</p>

  <p><strong>Why manual payments?</strong><br>
  Manual processing allows controlled onboarding and avoids third-party dependencies.</p>
